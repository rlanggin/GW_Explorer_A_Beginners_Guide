# GW Explorer: A Beginner's Guide

This project aims to introduce high-school students to the exciting field of Gravitational-Wave (GW) astrophysics through hands-on educational Python Jupyter Notebooks. The tutorials are designed to build a foundational understanding of both coding and GW astrophysics by guiding students step-by-step in exploring real GW data and analyses.

## Run in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com)
1. Download the Jupyter Notebooks (.ipynb files) 1–3 from the main repository (they will not render properly in Git due to interactive widgets).
2. Upload the notebooks to a folder in your Google Drive.
3. In Google Drive, right-click on the notebook file and select “Open with → Google Colaboratory”. (If you don’t see this option, you may need to install the [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com) Drive extension: `Open with` $\rightarrow$ `Connect more apps` $\rightarrow$ Find "Google Colaboratory")

## Repository Structure

- **Notebook Drafts (in main folder):**  
  Three Jupyter notebooks in draft form, each progressively exploring key concepts and data analysis techniques in Gravitational-Wave astronomy.
  - Notebook 1: Black holes & Spacetime
  - Notebook 2: Generating Waveforms
  - Notebook 3: Bayesian Parameter Estimation & Population Inference

  These are ready for review and testing.

- **short_result (folder):**  
  Contains JSON files with posterior results and output data supporting the analysis presented in the third notebook.

- **data (folder):**  
  Includes the [`GWTC-3.0-confident`](https://gwosc.org/eventapi/html/GWTC-3-confident/) event catalog in CSV format, providing population parameters used throughout the notebooks.

## Goals

- Engage students with interactive code exploring real Gravitational-Wave events.
- Demonstrate core concepts of Bayesian inference, parameter estimation, and astrophysical source properties.
- Foster computational skills with Python tools commonly used in GW research.
