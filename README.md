# GW Explorer: A Beginner's Guide

This project aims to introduce high-school students to the exciting field of Gravitational-Wave (GW) astrophysics through hands-on educational Python Jupyter Notebooks. The tutorials are designed to build a foundational understanding to both coding and GW astrophysics by guiding students step-by-step in exploring real GW data and analyses.

These notebooks are designed to be easily downloaded and run in Google Colab â€” simply download, upload to Google Drive, and run (only the notebooks are required)!

## Repository Structure

- **Notebook Drafts (in main folder):**  
  Three Jupyter notebooks in draft form, each progressively exploring key concepts and data analysis techniques in Gravitational-Wave astronomy.
  - Notebook 1: Black holes & Spacetime
  - Notebook 2: Generating Waveforms
  - Notebook 3: Bayesian Parameter Estimation & Population Inference
 
  These are ready for review and testing.

- **short_result (folder):**  
  Contains JSON files with posterior results and output data supporting the analysis presented in the third notebook.

- **data (folder):**  
  Includes the [`GWTC-3.0-confident`](https://gwosc.org/eventapi/html/GWTC-3-confident/) event catalog in CSV format, providing population parameters used throughout the notebooks.

## Goals

- Engage students with interactive code exploring real Gravitational-Wave events.
- Demonstrate core concepts of Bayesian inference, parameter estimation, and astrophysical source properties.
- Foster computational skills with Python tools commonly used in GW research.
