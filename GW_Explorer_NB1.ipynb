By building from basic Newtonian mechanics to the more abstract concepts of curved spacetime and gravitational radiation, students will gain an intuitive understanding of how black holes collide and how we detect their cosmic ripples on Earth.\n",

        "### 1. What factors determine the orbital speed of each black hole in a binary system?\n",
        "\n",
        "The orbital speed of each black hole is governed primarily by Newton’s law of universal gravitation and the conservation of angular momentum. Specifically, the masses of the two black holes and the distance between them are key. The gravitational force provides the centripetal force needed for orbit, so increasing the mass of either object or decreasing the distance between them results in higher orbital speeds. Additionally, the distribution of mass affects the relative velocities—more massive black holes tend to move slower than their lighter counterparts in a shared orbit. These relationships hold in Newtonian physics, but become even more intricate when relativistic effects are considered.\n",

        "\n",
        "### 2. Why do the black holes spiral inward rather than orbit forever?\n",
        "\n",
        "The inspiraling motion is a direct result of Gravitational Wave emission. As the black holes orbit one another, they disturb the curvature of spacetime, radiating energy away in the form of Gravitational Waves. Since energy is being lost from the system, the black holes lose orbital energy and spiral closer together. This process speeds up over time as they get closer, resulting in what’s known as the \"chirp\" signal in Gravitational Wave data. It’s a compelling demonstration of how the universe conserves energy not just through mass and motion, but also via spacetime curvature itself.\n",

        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### 3. How does the mass ratio influence the position of the center of mass and orbit radii?\n",
        "\n",
        "The center of mass of a binary system always lies along the line connecting the two objects but is offset toward the more massive body. If the masses are equal, the center of mass lies midway between them. However, as the mass ratio becomes more unequal, the center of mass shifts closer to the more massive black hole. This also affects the orbital radii—each object orbits around the center of mass, so the lighter object travels a wider path than the heavier one. This asymmetry can influence the Gravitational Wave signal’s shape and strength, which is something scientists can extract from the data.\n",

        "\n",
        "### 4. Try modifying the masses M1 and M2 in the code and observe the changes in the animation!\n",
        "\n",
        "When the masses are adjusted, several changes become apparent in the simulation. First, the orbital speed and radius of each object respond to the new mass ratio. Heavier masses spiral in faster due to greater gravitational attraction, while unequal masses create visibly unbalanced orbits. The center of mass visibly shifts toward the larger mass, and the waveform (if plotted) would show differences in amplitude and frequency. These observations raise deeper questions about how Gravitational Wave analyses distinguish mass ratios in real astrophysical events—and how sensitive our models must be to capture these nuances.\n",
